# Purpose:
The purpose of this challenge was to utilize Beautiful Soup and Splinter to scrape the images and titles of the Mar's hemispheres.  It would store the scrape on Mongo database, then use a web application to visually display the scrape.  It is help provide live updated data if needed for upper management to visually see the information. 

Below is the finale web scraping with a few added enhancements.  
* Changed the color of the button and made it flash so it's easier for people to see where to scrape new data.
* Change the title to a scroll and color background
* Add a light border around the hemisphere images
